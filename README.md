# Tracking Changes to Shopify's Partner Program Agreement

It's difficult to see exactly what's changed with each update to the Partner Program Agreement so I've stored different versions in git which makes it each to see the changes.

Each version of the agreement since 2020 is stored as a separate commit to `shopify-partner-agreement.md`. You can see the changes by looking through the commit history of the file.

I do some minor cleanup to the Markdown text so that the diffs between each version are cleaner. This repo is intended to give an idea of what changes are in the terms but is in no way legal advice. If you have any questions about the terms either reach out to Shopify or a lawyer.

## August 9, 2024 Update

You can see the changes from the August 9, 2024 update at https://github.com/d-beck/shopify-partner-agreement/commit/4d73022590876f6721a16889cb1a4f88e68a27e4?diff=split

The different versions are also stored in the `history` directory.
