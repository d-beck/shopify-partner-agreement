# Tracking Changes to Shopify's Partner Program Agreement

It's difficult to see exactly what's changed with each update to the Partner Program Agreement so I've stored different versions in git which makes it each to see the changes.

Each version of the agreement since 2020 is stored as a separate commit to `shopify-partner-agreement.md`. You can see the changes by looking through the commit history of the file. 

The different versions are also stored in the `history` directory.
