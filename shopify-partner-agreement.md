Amounts due to Partners from Merchants as the result of Partner using the Shopify Billing API are excluded from the term Fees. The revenue sharing plans applicable to the different types of Referral Partners are set out in [Part B.](#part-b) The revenue sharing plans applicable to the different types of Developers are set out in [Part C.](#part-c) The revenue sharing plans applicable to the Plus Partner Program are set out in [Part D.](#part-d)

#### 3.2. Payment

1.  Fees due to Partner under the Reference Plan will be calculated by Shopify once per month upon receipt of payment from the Merchant, for each month that the Referred Merchant Store is active. Fees due to Partner under the Bounty Plan will be calculated by Shopify once per month upon receipt of subscription revenue from the Merchant for two consecutive months.

2.  Shopify distributes Fees owing to its Partners and amounts due to Partner from Merchants where the Partner uses the Shopify Billing API twice per calendar month (each such period, a **“Payment Period”**). The first Payment Period occurs during the first half of the month, and the second Payment Period occurs during the second half of the month. The Fees described in Section 3.2.1 will be paid in either the first Payment Period or the second Payment Period, depending on the date that the Fee was calculated by Shopify. Where the Fees owing to Partner are greater than USD $25 at the end of any Payment Period, the Fees will be paid to Partner. If the Fees owing to Partner are less than USD $25 at the end of any Payment Period, Shopify will be entitled to withhold payment of Fees until the end of the next Payment Period in which the balance of unpaid Fees owing to Partner from any previous Payment Period and Fees owing to Partner under the current Payment Period are USD $25 or more.
3.  Any Fees payable by one Party to another Party that arise as the result of any activity under this Agreement shall be exclusive of Taxes. Such Taxes are in addition to any Fees. If you are exempt from payment of such Taxes, you must provide us with an original certificate that satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to tax-exempt status. Tax exemption will only apply from and after the date we receive such certificate. Partners are responsible for all applicable Taxes that arise from or as a result of any activities under this Agreement or with respect to Partners dealings with a Merchant. If Taxes are not collected by Shopify in respect of Fees or a Partner transaction with a Merchant, Partner is responsible for determining if Taxes are payable on such transaction, and if so, paying Taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Any Fees owing to Shopify by Partner shall be free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any withholding taxes of any taxing jurisdictions. If withholding taxes must be withheld from the Fees owing to Shopify, such Fees shall be increased such that the amount received by Shopify is the same as it would have been if no withholding taxes were withheld.
4.  Shopify will issue You an invoice for any Fees Shopify is charging You. Shopify will prepare an invoice, on Your behalf, to Shopify for any Fees that Shopify pays to you for referral activities. Invoices are generated when a payout is processed. You can't view invoices for pending transactions.
5.  For App Developers who obtain Shopify’s express written permission to forego use of the Shopify Billing API, the App Developer will submit payments due under the App Plan to Shopify monthly by way of wire transfer or Automated Clearing House (ACH). Any such payments made by the App Developers to Shopify will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any withholding taxes of any taxing jurisdictions. If withholding taxes must be withheld from any payment to Shopify, the App Developers shall increase the payment to Shopify such that the amount received by Shopify is the same as it would have been if no withholding taxes were withheld. The App Developer is responsible for contacting [app-commissions@shopify.com](mailto:app-commissions@shopify.com) to obtain the necessary banking information to execute the transfer. If the balance owed to Shopify is less than USD $1,000, App Developer may defer payment until the outstanding balance at the end of a payment period is USD $1,000 or more. If Developer owes Shopify any amounts for Ads pursuant to Part E, Section 1 below, then Shopify may reduce the Fees paid to Developer by offsetting amounts due from Developer to Shopify for Ads against Fees due from Shopify to Developer under this Agreement.
6.  Amounts due to Partner from a Merchant (where the Partner uses the Shopify Billing API) will be calculated by Shopify upon receipt of payment from the Merchant. Amounts for Apps with recurring billing will be calculated by Shopify upon receipt of payment for each month that the App is installed on the Merchant Store.

#### 3.3. Additional Payment Information

1.  All payments are subject to fraud and risk analysis considerations and anti-money laundering procedures and may be withheld by Shopify during the period of investigation. Shopify may also withhold payment if Partner fails to provide Shopify with information that is required to make payment.

    c. related to fraudulent sales;

    d. related to revenues that have been subject to chargebacks;

    f. to Partners who are employed by the Merchant to whom the Fees relate (whether full-time, part-time, term or any other employment-type relationship).

3.  If any Fees paid by Shopify are subsequently discovered to be subject to one or more of the exclusions set out in Section 3.3.2, or to have been paid in error, Shopify will have the right, at its sole discretion, to: (a) reclaim any Fees paid to Partner in error; or (b) set off the amounts described in Section 3.3 from payments due to Partner in future Payment Periods. If the Agreement is terminated before such amounts are fully repaid by Partner to Shopify, Partner will pay to Shopify the remaining balance within thirty (30) days of the effective date of termination of the Agreement.

4.  Shopify reserves the right to modify the Fees or the payment terms at any time upon reasonable advance notice to Partner. Such notice will be provided by email, posting a notice on the Shopify blog or in the Partner Dashboard. In the event of any disputes over Fees, Shopify’s determination will be final and binding.

To the extent, if any, that ownership of any Shopify Property does not automatically vest in Shopify by virtue of this Agreement, or otherwise, and vests in Partner, Partner hereby transfers and assigns to Shopify, upon the creation thereof, all rights, title and interest Partner may have in and to such Shopify Property (and waives any and all moral rights, as applicable), including the right to sue and recover for past, present and future violations thereof.

#### 5.5. Shopify’s Use of Partner’s Intellectual Property

Partner grants to Shopify a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable and sub-licensable right and licence to use and display in any manner the Partner's trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names, copyrighted content, graphic files, images and other intellectual property, in connection with and for the purpose of performing its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement. In addition, at Shopify's discretion, Shopify may use any such intellectual property for the purposes of promoting or marketing Partner, Partner's products or services, or as otherwise agreed to with Partner.

For the avoidance of doubt, as between Shopify and Partner, Merchant Data and Customer Data is the Confidential Information of Shopify.
2.  Each Party agrees to use the other Party’s/ies’ Confidential Information solely as necessary for performing its obligations under this Agreement and in accordance with any other obligations in this Agreement including this Section 6. Each Party agrees that it will take all reasonable steps, at least substantially equivalent to the steps it takes to protect its own proprietary information, to prevent the duplication, disclosure or use of any such Confidential Information, other than (i) by or to its employees, agents and subcontractors who must have access to such Confidential Information to perform such Party’s obligations under this Agreement, who each will treat such Confidential Information as provided in this Agreement, and who are each subject to obligations of confidentiality to such Party that are at least as stringent as those contained in this Agreement; or (ii) as required by any law, regulation, or order of any court of proper jurisdiction over the Parties and the subject matter contained in this Agreement, provided that, if legally permitted, the receiving Party will give the disclosing Party prompt written notice and use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such disclosure is accorded confidential treatment. Confidential Information will not include any information that the receiving Party can prove: (A) was already in the public domain, or was already known by or in the possession of the receiving Party, at the time of disclosure of such information; (B) is independently developed by the receiving Party without use of or reference to the other Party’s/ies’ Confidential Information, and without breaching any provisions of this Agreement; or (C) is thereafter rightly obtained by the receiving Party from a source other than the disclosing Party without breaching any provision of this Agreement.

### 7\. Disclaimer of warranty

The Shopify Partner Program, the Service, the Shopify Trademarks, the Shopify Creative, Ads (including delivery and related reporting) and the Shopify API (including without limitation the Sales Channel SDK and the Shopify Billing API) are provided “as-is”. Shopify makes no warranties under this Agreement, and Shopify expressly disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose. Without limiting the foregoing, Shopify further disclaims all representations and warranties, express or implied, that the Service, the Shopify API, the Shopify Trademarks, the Shopify Creative, or the Shopify API (including without limitation the Sales Channel SDK and the Shopify Billing API) satisfy all of Partner’s or Merchant’s requirements and or will be uninterrupted, error-free or free from harmful components.

### 8\. Limitation of Liability and Indemnification

#### 8.1. Limitation of Liability

Shopify, and the Shopify Related Entities, will have no liability with respect to the Shopify Partner Program, the Service, the Shopify API, the Shopify Trademarks, the Shopify Creative or Shopify’s obligations under this Agreement or otherwise for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for losses of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses resulting in any way from the Service, the Shopify API, the Shopify Trademarks, the Shopify Creative, or Partner’s participation or inability to participate in the Shopify Partner Program, even if Shopify has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In any event, Shopify’s, and the Shopify Related Entities’, liability to Partner under this Agreement for any reason will be limited to the Fees paid to Partner by Shopify during the six (6) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim for damages. This limitation applies to all causes of action in the aggregate, including, but not limited to, breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligence, strict liability, misrepresentations, and other torts. The relationship between a Merchant and a Partner is strictly between the Merchant and the Partner, and neither Shopify or the Shopify Related Entities are obligated to intervene in any dispute arising between the Merchant and the Partner. Under no circumstances will Shopify, or the Shopify Related Entities, be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, extraordinary, exemplary or other damages whatsoever, that result from or relate to the Partner’s relationship with any Merchant. These limitations will apply even if Shopify or the Shopify Related Entities have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Partner agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Shopify and any Shopify Related Entities and the directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents thereof (each, an **“Indemnified Party”**, and collectively, the **“Indemnified Parties”**), with respect to any claim, demand, cause of action, debt or liability, including reasonable attorneys’ fees (collectively, **“claims”**), to the extent that such claim is based upon or arises out of: (a) Partner’s breach of any representation, warranty, obligation or covenant under this Agreement; (b) Partner’s gross negligence or wilful misconduct; (c) any warranty, condition, representation, indemnity or guarantee relating to Shopify and Shopify Related Entities granted by Partner to any Merchant, prospective Partner or other third party; (d) Partner’s use of the Shopify API, (including without limitation the Sales Channel SDK and Shopify Billing API); (e) Partner’s breach of any term of this Agreement (including any documents it incorporates by reference) or a Merchant Agreement; (f) any third party claim that Partner’s products or services, including without limitation any Application, Theme, or Channel Platform infringes the intellectual property or other rights of a third party; (g) Partner Taxes, including any audits or penalties related thereto; (h) the performance, non-performance or improper performance of the Partner’s products or services, including without limitation, any Application or Theme or Channel Platform; (i) Partner’s relationship with any Merchant; and (j) any breach of applicable law by the Partner.

#### 8.3. Notice of Indemnification

In claiming any indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will promptly provide Partner with written notice of any claim which the Indemnified Party believes falls within the scope of the indemnifications provided under this Agreement. The Indemnified Party may, at its own expense, assist in the defense if it so chooses, provided that Partner will control such defense and all negotiations relative to the settlement of any such claim and further provided that in settling any claim the Partner will not make any admission on behalf of the Indemnified Party or agree to any terms or conditions that do or reasonably could result in any admission by, or the imposition of any liability upon, the Indemnified Party without the prior written approval of the Indemnified Party.

#### 8.4. Non-exclusive remedies

In the event of any breach or threatened breach by Partner of any provision of Sections 2, 3.2.5, 5 or 6 above, in addition to all other rights and remedies available to Shopify under this Agreement and under applicable law, Shopify will have the right to (a) immediately enjoin all such activity, without the necessity of showing damages or posting bond or other security, (b) immediately terminate this Agreement and Partner’s access to the Partner Program, (c) receive a prompt refund of all amounts paid to Partner under this Agreement, and (d) be indemnified for any losses, damages or liability incurred by Shopify in connection with such violation, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.

### 9\. General provisions

If the performance of any part of this Agreement by either Party is prevented, hindered, delayed or otherwise made impracticable by reason of any flood, riot, fire, judicial or governmental action (including, but not limited to, any law, regulation or embargo prohibiting the performance contemplated under this Agreement or the failure or refusal of a government agency to issue a license required for any performance pursuant to this Agreement), labour disputes, act of God or any cause beyond the reasonable control of that Party, the Party will be excused from such performance to the extent that it is prevented, hindered or delayed by such cause.

#### 9.5. No Waiver

The failure of any Party to insist upon or enforce strict performance by another Party of any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any right under this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such Party’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance; rather, the same will be and remain in full force and effect. Each waiver will be set forth in a written instrument signed by the waiving Party.

#### 9.6. Entire Agreement

Neither Shopify nor the Partner will be bound by, and each Party specifically objects to, any term, condition or other provision that is different from or in addition to the provisions of this Agreement (whether or not it would materially alter this Agreement) and which is proffered by another Party in any correspondence or other document, unless the Party to be bound thereby specifically agrees to such provision in writing.

This Agreement may be available in languages other than English. To the extent of any inconsistencies or conflicts between this English Agreement and the Agreements available in another language, the most current English version of the Agreement will prevail.

Part B - Additional Terms Applicable to Referral Partners
---------------------------------------------------------

This Part B contains terms applicable to Referral Partners generally.

### 1\. FTC Guidelines

1.  The Federal Trade Commission in the United States (**“FTC”**) has guidelines for governing endorsements and testimonials. These rules are aimed at increasing transparency between endorsers and consumers. As a member of the Partner Program with Shopify, Partner receives compensation for the Referred Merchant referrals made to Shopify. This may establish a “material connection” according to FTC rules, which creates an obligation for Partner to provide disclosure to consumers.
2.  Full compliance with these guidelines requires, among other things, that (a) Partner clearly and conspicuously disclose that Partner is being compensated for referring Referred Merchants to Shopify, and (b) Partner not engage in misleading or deceptive advertising. For further information Partner should refer to the statement released by the FTC regarding these guidelines.

### 2\. Revenue Sharing Plans for Referral Partners

1.  The **“Reference Plan”** is a revenue sharing plan applicable to Partners that introduce Shopify to a Referred Merchant through a Development Store associated with the Referral Partner’s Partner Dashboard. Under the Reference Plan, a Partner is entitled to a percentage of certain revenue received from such Referred Merchant, to be determined by Shopify in its sole discretion, with Shopify being entitled to the remaining percentage. A description of the current revenue share percentages applicable to Partners and amounts eligible to be included in the Partner’s revenue share is available at: [help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn](https://help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn). Shopify reserves the right to revise the revenue share applicable to the Reference Plan, and any ongoing obligations to receive revenue share from time to time, at its sole discretion, upon reasonable prior notice to Partner. Such notice will be provided by email, posting a notice on the Shopify blog, or in the Partner Dashboard.
2.  The **“Bounty Plan”** is a bonus plan that pays Partner a fixed, one-time payment (**“Bounty”**) when the Partner introduces Shopify to a Referred Merchant using the Partner Affiliate Link. The Bounty Plan is not applicable in respect of the Shopify Plus plan. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Shopify, under the Bounty Plan, when a Referred Merchant is referred by a Partner to a Shopify plan (other than Shopify Plus), Partner will receive a fixed one-time Bounty of two hundred percent (200%) of one-month’s subscription revenue received from such Referred Merchant. Any Bounty payable to a Partner will be paid in two parts. The first half of the Bounty will be paid within 30 days after the Referred Merchant pays Shopify their first monthly subscription fee. The second half of the bounty will be paid within 30 days of the end of the calendar month in which the first half of the Bounty was paid. The Bounty Plan may also apply where a Referred Merchant is introduced to Shopify by more than one Referral Partner. See [help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn](https://help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn) for more details. Shopify reserves the right to revise the revenue share amounts applicable to the Bounty Plan from time to time, at its sole discretion, upon reasonable prior notice to Partner. Such notice will be provided by email, posting a notice on the Shopify blog or in the Partner Dashboard.
3.  For each Referral Merchant, Partner will be entitled to receive Fees from either the Reference Plan or the Bounty Plan, but not both. Where Partner introduces Shopify to a Referred Merchant through a Development Store associated with the Referral Partner's Dashboard, the Partner will be entitled to receive Fees in accordance with the Reference Plan. Where a Partner introduces Shopify to a Referred Merchant through the Referral Partner’s Affiliate Link, the Partner will be entitled to receive Fees in accordance with the Bounty Plan. Whether the Partner receives Fees in respect of a Referred Merchant under either the Reference Plan or the Bounty Plan is at Shopify’s sole and absolute discretion. To learn more about the Reference Plan and Bounty Plan, please visit [help.shopify.com/partners/how-to-earn](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/how-to-earn).
4.  Shopify reserves the right to (i) demand and receive information from Referral Partners about any Referred Merchant, including but not limited to information with respect to traffic sources and methods used to acquire the Referred Merchant, and (ii) assess the legitimacy and qualification of such Referred Merchant for the purposes of determining whether a Fee is payable for such Referred Merchant. Shopify will not be responsible to pay any Fees for a Referred Merchant owned in whole or in part by a Referral Partner or Referral Partner’s employer (whether full-time, part-time, term or any other employment type relationship).

### 3\. Responsibilities

Referral Partners will use their best efforts to (i) promote and market Shopify, and (ii) identify for Shopify prospective Referred Merchants.

### 4\. Unauthorized and Prohibited Activities

1.  A Partner will not:
    1.  promote or advertise Shopify or Shopify Related Entities on coupon, deal, or discount sites or on GTP/Get Paid to Click or other incentivized sites, or display any offer code on a public-facing page or through the use of a “click to display” offer code;
    2.  use its Affiliate Link directly in any pay-per-click advertising;
    3.  purchase search engine or other pay-per-click keywords (such as Google Ads), trademarks or domain names that use the Shopify Trademarks or the names or trademarks of any Shopify Related Entities or any variations or misspellings thereof that may be deceptively or confusingly similar to the Shopify Trademarks or the names or trademarks of any Shopify Related Entity;
    4.  create or participate in any third party networks or sub-affiliate networks without the express written permission of Shopify;
    5.  use or encourage any means of delivering fraudulent traffic, including but not limited to use of bots or toolbar traffic, cookie stuffing, or use of false or misleading links;
    6.  use direct linking to any page on any Shopify website, without prior written permission from Shopify; or
    7.  mask its referral sites or use deceptive redirecting links.
2.  A Referred Merchant cannot be a store opened or owned by a Partner and for which that Partner seeks compensation pursuant to this Agreement. A Partner will be deemed to have introduced only those Referred Merchants that: (a) access Shopify from that Partner’s Affiliate Link assigned by Shopify; or (b) are added through a Development Store within the Partner’s Shopify Partner Dashboard.
3.  Applications and Themes are non-transferrable, non-assignable and non-sublicensable, unless otherwise stated in the applicable Developer’s terms of use. VAPs are not permitted to copy, duplicate, transfer or sell a purchased Application or Theme used for one Merchant’s store to any other Merchant’s store on Shopify or elsewhere.

### 5\. Development Stores

During the development of a Merchant Store by the VAP on behalf of a Merchant, the VAP may designate the store as a Development Store. A Development Store is not publicly visible and is not subject to monthly subscription fees. A Development Store cannot be used to process orders on behalf of the Partner or the Merchant; provided, however, that Development Stores may be used to process test orders. A Development Store is deemed to become a Merchant Store upon the earlier of: (a) the payment of monthly subscription fees for the store by either the VAP or Merchant; and (b) the transfer by the VAP of ownership of the Development Store to the Merchant, at which time the VAP or the Merchant’s use of the Merchant Store will be subject to the [Shopify Terms of Service](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms).

### 6\. Relationship between VAP and Merchant

The services provided by a VAP to a Merchant are the responsibility of the VAP and not of Shopify. It is the VAP’s responsibility to ensure that there is a Merchant Agreement in place between the VAP and Merchant for the services to be provided by the VAP to the Merchant, and that the Merchant Agreement includes appropriate remedies in the event of non-payment by Merchant for services rendered by the VAP, provided that any such remedy that includes the withholding of the transfer of ownership of the Development Store or Merchant Store to the Merchant will be enforced by Shopify at its sole discretion. In the event of a dispute between the VAP and the Merchant, Shopify is not obligated to intervene in any such dispute. Under no circumstances will Shopify be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, extraordinary, exemplary or other damages whatsoever, that result from or relate to the transfer of ownership of the Development Store or Merchant Store to the Merchant by Shopify, or the VAP’s relationship with any Merchant. These limitations will apply even if Shopify has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitations will apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

Prohibit reviews, limit the content, type of or forum for reviews, or solicit or permit reviews that are fake, inaccurate, irrelevant, misleading, being used improperly for commercial gain, posted in exchange for a financial or other gain, posted multiple times (whether from the same or more than one account), misleading as to the reviewer's identity or their connection to the Application or Theme being reviewed, or reviews that contain or link to prohibited or illegal content. Reviews on the Shopify App Store and Shopify Theme Store are meant to be unbiased, useful and trustworthy. Shopify reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary in respect of a Partner engaged in any of this behaviour, including the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit reviews;
2.  Include code in any Application which performs any operations not related to the services provided by the Application, whether or not Developer has obtained Merchant consent to do so, and whether or not the Application obtains consent from the end user to do so. For the avoidance of doubt, this prohibited activity includes: embedding or incorporating code into any Application which utilizes the resources (including CPU resources) of another computer, including for the purposes of cryptocurrency mining; using code that is intended to misrepresent website content to falsify SEO metrics; and injecting obfuscated code into into, or otherwise through, an App, Theme, any Partner Program resource or activity, or the Service;
3.  Develop or distribute the Application or Theme in any way in furtherance of criminal, fraudulent, or other unlawful activity, or otherwise violate the [Shopify Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.shopify.com/legal/aup); or
4.  Create multiple Applications that offer substantially the same services.
5.  Replace or change credit card input fields or any other similar component or field within the Shopify Checkout, without Shopify's prior written consent.

### 3\. Additional Shopify Trademark License for Developers

Developers may use the Shopify Trademarks licensed in Section 5.2 for the sole purpose of notifying Merchants that the Application or Theme is compatible with the Service.

### 4\. Use of the Shopify Billing API

Unless otherwise agreed to by Shopify in writing, if a Developer will create and issue charges to Merchants relating to the Merchants’ use or installation of the Developer’s Application, whether in the form of monthly subscription fees, cost-per-acquisition, cost-per-click, percentage commission or otherwise, Developer must use the Shopify Billing API. The Shopify Billing API includes software to help Developers manage billing charges to Merchants for use of Developer’s Applications. It is the Developer’s responsibility to: (i) obtain Merchant consent to create and issue such charges and (ii) bill the Merchant in compliance with the Merchant Agreement, applicable legal requirements and card network payment rules.

### C.1. Additional Terms Applicable to Theme Developers

#### 1\. Theme Requirements

1.  Theme Developers are permitted to develop Themes for Merchants to be distributed in the Shopify Theme Store. Select Themes (as defined in Section 2 below) developed for Shopify Merchants, may be made accessible to Shopify Merchants only through the Shopify Theme Store.

All Themes are subject to approval and acceptance by Shopify and Shopify retains the right to remove a Select Theme from the Shopify Theme Store at any time and for any reason.
2.  Theme Developers must follow all Shopify guidelines set out at [https://shopify.dev/themes/store/requirements](https://shopify.dev/themes/store/requirements) with respect to their Theme.

Theme Developer further represents and warrants that no part of the Theme will violate or infringe upon any copyright or any other rights whatsoever of any third party.

#### 2\. Revenue Sharing Plans and Fees for Theme Developers

1.  The **“Theme Plan”** is a revenue sharing plan which allocates revenue between Shopify and a Theme Developer whose Theme has been selected to be sold through the Shopify Theme Store (each such Theme, a **“Select Theme”**). Unless otherwise indicated in this Agreement, in any Additional Terms, agreed to by Shopify in writing or required by Shopify from time to time, the Theme Plan will apply as follows:
    1.  A Theme Developer owes Shopify, per calendar year, (a) zero percent (0%) of the first USD $1 million of the total revenues from the sale of the Theme Developer’s Select Themes (**“USD $1 million threshold”**), and (b) fifteen percent (15%) of any such revenues exceeding the USD $1 million threshold.
    2.  The Theme Plan applies to Theme Developers in accordance with the requirements set out at: [https://shopify.dev/themes/store/revenue-share](https://shopify.dev/themes/store/revenue-share), or as otherwise set out by Shopify from time to time.
    3.  For the purposes of this Section C.1.2.1:

2.  Any Party may terminate the Agreement immediately in the event another Party commits a material breach of the Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receiving written notice thereof.

Where an App Developer’s Application classifies as both a Blockchain Application and another type of Application (including without limitation a Payments Application), the indemnification obligations in this Section C.6.5 shall control. For the avoidance of doubt, Part A, Sections 8.2 and 8.3, of the Agreement shall continue to govern and apply to non-Blockchain Developers and activities that are not specifically related to Blockchain Applications. This Section C.6.5 shall survive any termination or expiration of the Partner Agreement.

1.  **Partner Indemnification**. Partner agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and upon Shopify’s request, assume the defense of, Shopify and any Shopify Related Entities and the directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents thereof (each, an “**Indemnified Party**”, and collectively, the “**Indemnified Parties**”), with respect to any claim, demand, cause of action, debt, losses, or liability, whether or not foreseeable, including but not limited to any costs of investigation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and court costs (collectively, “**claims**”), arising from or relating to the following: (a) Partner’s breach of any representation, warranty, obligation or covenant under this Agreement; (b) Partner’s negligence or willful misconduct; (c) any warranty, condition, representation, indemnity or guarantee relating to Shopify and Shopify Related Entities granted by Partner to any Merchant, prospective Partner or other third party; (d) Partner’s use of the Shopify API (including without limitation the Sales Channel SDK and Shopify Billing API); (e) Partner’s breach of any term of this Agreement (including any documents it incorporates by reference) or a Merchant Agreement; (f) any violation of any law or regulation by Partner; (g) any third party claim that Partner’s products or services, including without limitation any Application, Theme, or Channel Platform, does not comply with any law or regulation or infringe the rights, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, of any person; (h) Partner Taxes, including any audits or penalties related thereto; (i) the performance, nonperformance or improper or defective performance of Partner’s products or services, including without limitation, any Application or Theme or Channel Platform; and (j) Partner’s relationship with any Merchant.

2.  **Notice of Indemnification**. In claiming any indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will promptly provide Partner with written notice of any claim which the Indemnified Party believes falls within the scope of the indemnifications provided under this Agreement. Failure to give such prompt written notice shall not relieve Partner of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that Partner forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Partner may, at its own expense, assist in the defense if it so chooses, provided that, unless Partner has been asked to assume control of the defense under the section above, Indemnified Party will control such defense and all negotiations relative to the settlement of any such claim. For any claim in relation to which Indemnified Party has assumed control of the defense, Partner shall fully cooperate with Indemnified Party in connection therewith and shall reimburse Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the costs properly incurred in defending against the claim (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) and remain responsible to Indemnified Party for any claims indemnified under the section above. For any claim in relation to which Partner has assumed control of the defense, Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate with Partner in connection therewith and may employ, at any time, separate counsel to represent it; provided, that Partner is responsible for the costs and expenses of such separate counsel. Partner shall not enter into any settlement or agreement with any person that affects the Indemnified Party’s rights or binds the Indemnified Party in any way without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party.

Part D – Additional Terms Applicable to the Partner Directory and the Shopify Plus Partner Program
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the terms applicable to all Referral Partners, as set out in [Part B](#part-b), the following terms apply to the Partner Directory and Partners accepted into the Plus Partner Program.

### 1\. Partner Directory

1.  **Directory**. Partners may be listed in the Partner Directory. Merchants may contact Partners listed in the Partner Directory.
2.  **Communications**. Partner acknowledges and agrees that Shopify receives and can review all communications exchanged via the Partner Directory or in any reply emails that originate within the Partner Directory (directly or indirectly) between Partner and Merchant. As a participant in the Partner Directory, Partner consents to being contacted by Merchants at the email address provided by Partner to Shopify.
3.  **Relationship**. The services provided by a Partner via the Partner Directory are the responsibility of the Partner and not of Shopify. It is the Partner’s responsibility to ensure that there is a Merchant Agreement in place between the Partner and Merchant for the services to be provided by the Partner to the Merchant, and that the Merchant Agreement includes appropriate remedies in the event of non-payment by Merchant for services rendered by the Partner, provided that any such remedy that includes the withholding of the transfer of ownership of the Development Store or Merchant Store to the Merchant will be enforced by Shopify at its sole discretion.
4.  **Reviews**. Merchants are able to submit reviews and ratings on their experience with a Partner. An Partner’s rating is calculated based on reviews posted by Merchants. Partners may not solicit or permit reviews that are fake, inaccurate, irrelevant, misleading, being used improperly for commercial gain, posted in exchange for a financial or other gain, posted multiple times (whether from the same or more than one account), misleading as to the reviewer's identity or their connection to the Partner being reviewed, or reviews that contain or link to prohibited or illegal content. Reviews are meant to be unbiased, useful and trustworthy. Shopify reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary in respect of a Partner engaged in any of this behaviour, including the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit Merchant reviews.

### 2\. Plus Partner Program

1.  **Designation**. From time to time Shopify may designate certain of its Partners as a **“Plus Partner”**, to be listed on the [Plus Partner Program site](https://www.shopify.com/plus/partners). A Plus Partner will be required to execute a Plus Partner Program addendum. The granting of a Plus Partner designation is entirely within Shopify’s discretion.

2.  **Revenue Sharing Plan**. The revenue sharing plan for the Plus Partner Program is set out in a Plus Partner addendum.

### 3\. Removal of Designation

Shopify may remove the Plus Partner designation at any time and for any reason, in its sole and absolute discretion, effective immediately upon notice to the relevant Plus Partner. Upon notice of the revocation of such designation by Shopify, Shopify will remove Partner from the Plus Partner Program resources, and Partner will immediately cease referring to itself as a Plus Partner on any Website or otherwise.

Part E – Additional Terms Applicable to Ads in the Shopify App Store
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the terms applicable to Developers elsewhere in this Agreement, the following terms apply to Ads.

### 1\. Fees

1.  **Auctions**. The price Developers pay for an Ad, and whether or not the Developer wins an auction for an Ad to be displayed, will be based upon (1) the daily budget set by the Developer in the Partner Dashboard, (2) the amount bid for various keywords and (3) a confidential relevance score created by Shopify to ensure that Merchants and other users see Ads that are relevant and valuable to them. Shopify will solely determine which Ads will be shown and nothing in this Agreement guarantees that Developer will win any auctions to display their Ads, have their Ads displayed or get any impressions or clicks. All bids entered by Developer are binding offers from Developer which may be accepted or rejected by Shopify in its sole discretion.
2.  **Pricing**. The Developer will be charged for an Ad on a cost per click basis.
3.  **Payments**. The Developer will provide a payment method to Shopify and hereby authorizes Shopify to automatically charge such payment method for Ads purchased in compliance with this Agreement. Developer may not set-off any of its payments for Ads against any other amounts due to Developer under this Agreement. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by Shopify, Developer’s payment method may be charged by Shopify (1) each time the Developer reaches $100 in Ad fees, including if necessary, multiple times per day, or (2) every thirty (30) days, whichever comes first.

### 2\. Ads

1.  **Content**. Most of the content of the Ads will be generated by Shopify and will not be customizable by the Developer. Ad names and all other content provided by Developer must comply with Shopify’s Acceptable Use Policy. You hereby grant Shopify a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully paid license to store, use, reproduce and display any Ad names or other content provided by Developer for purposes of delivering the Ads and managing the service herein. Except as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to be a transfer, license or assignment of any intellectual property rights.
2.  **Keywords**. While the Developer may request certain triggering keywords for the Ads and negative triggering keywords as well, Shopify may prohibit and block the use of any keywords in its discretion. If broad keywords are selected by Developer, the actual triggering keywords implemented will be determined by Shopify in its sole discretion.

### 3\. Reporting

1.  **Reporting**. Shopify will provide the Developer with access to reporting through the Partner Dashboard. Shopify’s reporting is the sole and definitive measure of payment obligations for the Ads. All data in such reporting, and all usage and conversion data generated as a result of the Ads, is owned by Shopify. Developer may only use the reporting and metrics provided by Shopify to Developer for the performance and management of this Agreement and for its internal business purposes. Such reporting may not be shared by Developer with any third parties (other than on a confidential basis to its accountants and financial advisors).
2.  **Disputes**. In the event that Developer disputes any reporting, Developer must notify Shopify in writing within seven (7) days of the date the report is first made available to Developer by Shopify, otherwise the Developer acknowledges the accuracy of such reporting and waives any claims based upon such reporting thereafter.
3.  **Fraud**. The Developer agrees not to engage in, encourage, assist or authorize any third party to generate fraudulent traffic with respect to the Ads of any party, including but not limited to, through the use of bots or other means.
