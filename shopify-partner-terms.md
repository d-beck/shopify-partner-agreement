#### 3.2. Payment

1.  Fees due to Partner under the [Reference Plan](#section-b2-1) will be calculated by Shopify once per month upon receipt of payment from the Merchant, for each month that the Referred Merchant Store is active, provided that Partner has carried out at least one (1) Revenue Generating Activity in the immediately preceding 12-month period (as set out in Part B, Section 3.1). Fees due to Partner under the [App Plan](#section-c2-2) (where the App Developer uses the Shopify Billing API) or the [Theme Plan](#section-c1-2) will be calculated by Shopify upon receipt of payment from the Merchant for the applicable App or Theme. Fees for Apps with recurring billing will be calculated by Shopify upon receipt of payment for each month that the App is installed on the Merchant Store. Fees due to Partner under the [Bounty Plan](#section-b2-2) will be calculated by Shopify once per month upon receipt of subscription revenue from the Merchant for two consecutive months.

The first Payment Period occurs during the first half of the month, and the second Payment Period occurs during the second half of the month. The Fees described in Section 3.2.1 will be paid in either the first Payment Period or the second Payment Period, depending on the date that the Fee was calculated by Shopify. Where the Fees owing to Partner are greater than USD $25 at the end of any Payment Period, the Fees will be paid to Partner. If the Fees owing to Partner are less than USD $25 at the end of any Payment Period, Shopify will be entitled to withhold payment of Fees until the end of the next Payment Period in which the balance of unpaid Fees owing to Partner from any previous Payment Period and Fees owing to Partner under the current Payment Period are USD $25 or more.
    
3.  Partners are responsible for all applicable Taxes that arise from or as a result of any activities under this Agreement or with respect to Partners dealings with a Merchant. If Taxes are not collected by Shopify in respect of a Partner transaction with a Merchant facilitated by Shopify, Partner is responsible for determining if Taxes are payable on such transaction, and if so, self-remitting Taxes to the appropriate tax authorities.
    
4.  Shopify will issue you an invoice for any commission fees Shopify is charging you for activities like app sales, theme sales, and service sales. Shopify will prepare an invoice, on your behalf, to Shopify for any commission fees that Shopify pays to you for referral activities. Fee and commission invoices are generated when a payout is processed. You can't view invoices for pending transactions.
    
5.  For App Developers who obtain Shopify’s express written permission to forego use of the Shopify Billing API, the App Developer will submit payments due under the [App Plan](#section-c1-2) to Shopify monthly by way of wire transfer or Automated Clearing House (ACH). The App Developer is responsible for contacting [app-commissions@shopify.com](mailto:app-commissions@shopify.com) to obtain the necessary banking information to execute the transfer. If the balance owed to Shopify is less than USD $1,000, App Developer may defer payment until the outstanding balance at the end of a payment period is USD $1,000 or more. If Developer owes Shopify any amounts for Ads pursuant to Part E, Section 1 below, then Shopify may reduce the Fees paid to Developer by offsetting amounts due from Developer to Shopify for Ads against Fees due from Shopify to Developer under this Agreement.
    

#### 3.3. Additional Payment Information

Shopify may also withhold payment if Partner fails to provide Shopify with information that is required to make payment.

    f. to Partners who are employed by the Merchant to whom the Fees relate (whether full-time, part-time, term or any other employment-type relationship).
    
3.  If any Fees paid by Shopify are subsequently discovered to be subject to one or more of the exclusions set out in Section 3.3.2, or to have been paid in error, Shopify will have the right, at its sole discretion, to: (a) reclaim any Fees paid to Partner in error; or (b) set off the amounts described in Section 3.3 from payments due to Partner in future Payment Periods. If the Agreement is terminated before such amounts are fully repaid by Partner to Shopify, Partner will pay to Shopify the remaining balance within thirty (30) days of the effective date of termination of the Agreement.
    
4.  Shopify reserves the right to modify the Fees or the payment terms at any time upon reasonable advance notice to Partner. Such notice will be provided by email, posting a notice on the Shopify blog or in the Partner Dashboard.

Part B - Additional Terms Applicable to Referral Partners
---------------------------------------------------------

This Part B contains terms applicable to Referral Partners generally.

### 1\. FTC Guidelines

1.  The Federal Trade Commission in the United States (**“FTC”**) has guidelines for governing endorsements and testimonials. These rules are aimed at increasing transparency between endorsers and consumers. As a member of the Partner Program with Shopify, Partner receives compensation for the Referred Merchant referrals made to Shopify. This may establish a “material connection” according to FTC rules, which creates an obligation for Partner to provide disclosure to consumers.
    
2.  Full compliance with these guidelines requires, among other things, that (a) Partner clearly and conspicuously disclose that Partner is being compensated for referring Referred Merchants to Shopify, and (b) Partner not engage in misleading or deceptive advertising. For further information Partner should refer to the statement released by the FTC regarding these guidelines.
    

### 2\. Revenue Sharing Plans for Referral Partners

1.  The **“Reference Plan”** is a revenue sharing plan applicable to Partners that introduce Shopify to a Referred Merchant through a Development Store associated with the Referral Partner’s Partner Dashboard. Under the Reference Plan, a Partner is entitled to a percentage of certain revenue received from such Referred Merchant, to be determined by Shopify in its sole discretion, with Shopify being entitled to the remaining percentage. In order to continue receiving revenue share for the Merchants referred under the Reference Plan, Partner must carry out at least one Revenue Generating Activity in each consecutive 12-month period. A description of the current revenue share percentages applicable to Partners, amounts eligible to be included in the Partner’s revenue share, and a description of current Revenue Generating Activities is available at: [help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn](https://help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn). Shopify reserves the right to revise the revenue share applicable to the Reference Plan, and any ongoing obligations to receive revenue share (including required Revenue Generating Activities) from time to time, at its sole discretion, upon reasonable prior notice to Partner. Such notice will be provided by email, posting a notice on the Shopify blog, or in the Partner Dashboard.
    
2.  The **“Bounty Plan”** is a bonus plan that pays Partner a fixed, one-time payment (**“Bounty”**) when the Partner introduces Shopify to a Referred Merchant using the Partner Affiliate Link. The Bounty Plan is not applicable in respect of the Shopify Plus plan. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Shopify, under the Bounty Plan, when a Referred Merchant is referred by a Partner to a Shopify plan (other than Shopify Plus), Partner will receive a fixed one-time Bounty of two hundred percent (200%) of one-month’s subscription revenue received from such Referred Merchant. Any Bounty payable to a Partner will be paid in two parts. The first half of the Bounty will be paid within 30 days after the Referred Merchant pays Shopify their first monthly subscription fee. The second half of the bounty will be paid within 30 days of the end of the calendar month in which the first half of the Bounty was paid. The Bounty Plan may also apply where a Referred Merchant is introduced to Shopify by more than one Referral Partner. See [help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn](https://help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn) for more details. Shopify reserves the right to revise the revenue share amounts applicable to the Bounty Plan from time to time, at its sole discretion, upon reasonable prior notice to Partner. Such notice will be provided by email, posting a notice on the Shopify blog or in the Partner Dashboard.
    
3.  For each Referral Merchant, Partner will be entitled to receive Fees from either the Reference Plan or the Bounty Plan, but not both. Where Partner introduces Shopify to a Referred Merchant through a Development Store associated with the Referral Partner's Dashboard, the Partner will be entitled to receive Fees in accordance with the Reference Plan. Where a Partner introduces Shopify to a Referred Merchant through the Referral Partner’s Affiliate Link, the Partner will be entitled to receive Fees in accordance with the Bounty Plan. Whether the Partner receives Fees in respect of a Referred Merchant under either the Reference Plan or the Bounty Plan is at Shopify’s sole and absolute discretion. To learn more about the Reference Plan and Bounty Plan, please visit [help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/getting-paid](https://help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/getting-paid).
    
4.  Shopify reserves the right to (i) demand and receive information from Referral Partners about any Referred Merchant, including but not limited to information with respect to traffic sources and methods used to acquire the Referred Merchant, and (ii) assess the legitimacy and qualification of such Referred Merchant for the purposes of determining whether a Fee is payable for such Referred Merchant. Shopify will not be responsible to pay any Fees for a Referred Merchant owned in whole or in part by a Referral Partner or Referral Partner’s employer (whether full-time, part-time, term or any other employment type relationship).
    

### 3\. Responsibilities

Referral Partners will use their best efforts to (i) promote and market Shopify, and (ii) identify for Shopify prospective Referred Merchants.

### 4\. Unauthorized and Prohibited Activities

1.  A Partner will not:
    
    1.  promote or advertise Shopify or Shopify Related Entities on coupon, deal, or discount sites or on GTP/Get Paid to Click or other incentivized sites, or display any offer code on a public-facing page or through the use of a “click to display” offer code;
    2.  use its Affiliate Link directly in any pay-per-click advertising;
    3.  purchase search engine or other pay-per-click keywords (such as Google Ads), trademarks or domain names that use the Shopify Trademarks or the names or trademarks of any Shopify Related Entities or any variations or misspellings thereof that may be deceptively or confusingly similar to the Shopify Trademarks or the names or trademarks of any Shopify Related Entity;
    4.  create or participate in any third party networks or sub-affiliate networks without the express written permission of Shopify;
    5.  use or encourage any means of delivering fraudulent traffic, including but not limited to use of bots or toolbar traffic, cookie stuffing, or use of false or misleading links;
    6.  use direct linking to any page on any Shopify website, without prior written permission from Shopify; or
    7.  mask its referral sites or use deceptive redirecting links.
2.  A Referred Merchant cannot be a store opened or owned by a Partner and for which that Partner seeks compensation pursuant to this Agreement. A Partner will be deemed to have introduced only those Referred Merchants that: (a) access Shopify from that Partner’s Affiliate Link assigned by Shopify; or (b) are added through a Development Store within the Partner’s Shopify Partner Dashboard.
    
3.  Applications and Themes are non-transferrable, non-assignable and non-sublicensable, unless otherwise stated in the applicable Developer’s terms of use. VAPs are not permitted to copy, duplicate, transfer or sell a purchased Application or Theme used for one Merchant’s store to any other Merchant’s store on Shopify or elsewhere.
    

### 5\. Development Stores

During the development of a Merchant Store by the VAP on behalf of a Merchant, the VAP may designate the store as a Development Store. A Development Store is not publicly visible and is not subject to monthly subscription fees. A Development Store cannot be used to process orders on behalf of the Partner or the Merchant; provided, however, that Development Stores may be used to process test orders. A Development Store is deemed to become a Merchant Store upon the earlier of: (a) the payment of monthly subscription fees for the store by either the VAP or Merchant; and (b) the transfer by the VAP of ownership of the Development Store to the Merchant.

### 6\. Relationship between VAP and Merchant

The services provided by a VAP to a Merchant are the responsibility of the VAP and not of Shopify. It is the VAP’s responsibility to ensure that there is a Merchant Agreement in place between the VAP and Merchant for the services to be provided by the VAP to the Merchant, and that the Merchant Agreement includes appropriate remedies in the event of non-payment by Merchant for services rendered by the VAP, provided that any such remedy that includes the withholding of the transfer of ownership of the Development Store or Merchant Store to the Merchant will be enforced by Shopify at its sole discretion. In the event of a dispute between the VAP and the Merchant, Shopify is not obligated to intervene in any such dispute. Under no circumstances will Shopify be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, extraordinary, exemplary or other damages whatsoever, that result from or relate to the transfer of ownership of the Development Store or Merchant Store to the Merchant by Shopify, or the VAP’s relationship with any Merchant. These limitations will apply even if Shopify has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitations will apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

If Channel Developer has access to Merchant shipping information via the Service, including rates or time in transit information (“Shipping Information”), Channel Developer: (i) will only store, access, use or process Shipping Information as necessary to provide Merchants with shipping services as directed by Merchant and under no circumstance will Channel Developer aggregate Shipping Information for multiple Merchants, or for any particular Merchant, for any purpose; and (ii) will use at least industry standard measures for the protection of proprietary and confidential information to protect against unauthorized access to, disclosure of or use of Shipping Information. To the extent that the Shipping Information includes information of UPS Market Driver, Inc., and no further, then UPS Market Driver, Inc. will be a third-party beneficiary with all rights and privileges of Shopify under this Section C.3.1.8 and is entitled to enforce this Section C.3.1.8 directly against Channel Developer.
    

#### 2\. Revenue Sharing Plans for Channel Developers

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, Channel Developers who use the Checkout API to integrate the Channel Application into the Service will retain 100% of the revenues from Merchant charges billed through the Shopify Billing API as described in Section C.3.1(d) above.

#### 3\. Sales Channel SDK

1.  Channel Developer will apply to Shopify for access to the Sales Channel SDK, which will be granted or denied in Shopify’s sole discretion.
    
2.  The Shopify API Terms apply to Channel Developer’s use of the Sales Channel SDK. In addition to, and without limiting the generality of the restrictions in Section 2.3 of the Shopify API Terms, with respect to the Sales Channel SDK, Channel Developer will:
    
    1.  upon request from Shopify, provide Shopify with a report setting out the number of, and location of, all copies of the Sales Channel SDK;
    2.  not use the Sales Channel SDK for any purpose other than for the Channel Program and the development of the Channel Application; and
    3.  not use the Sales Channel SDK to develop products or services that will compete with Shopify’s products or services.

#### 4\. Term and Termination for Channel Applications

Subject to the following, Channel Developer agrees to maintain its Channel Application for twelve (12) months from the date that the Channel Application is made available by Shopify in the Shopify App Store:

1.  Beginning on the six-month anniversary of the Channel Application being published in the Shopify App Store, the Parties may terminate this Agreement at any time if it is mutually agreed, after good faith negotiations, that (i) there is insufficient adoption of the Channel Application by Merchants; or (ii) maintaining the Channel Application is commercially or technically unfeasible for either Shopify or Channel Developer.
    
2.  Any Party may terminate the Agreement immediately in the event another Party commits a material breach of the Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receiving written notice thereof. If the breach is cured (or waived by the non-breaching Party) within the specified cure period, then the Agreement will continue in full force and effect pursuant to its terms.
    

### C.4. Additional Terms Applicable to Payment Gateway Developers

1.  Payment Gateway Developers are permitted to develop Payment Gateway Applications that integrate a payment gateway and the Service. Payment Gateway Applications may be made available to Merchants privately or, if approved by Shopify, publicly within the Merchant’s admin and Shopify’s public list of [payment gateways](https://www.shopify.com/payment-gateways). Payment Gateway Developer must comply with the [Shopify API Terms](https://www.shopify.com/legal/api-terms) and the [Shopify Hosted Payment SDK guidelines](https://help.shopify.com/api/sdks/hosted-payment-sdk). For the avoidance of doubt, Payment Gateway Applications that (a) use the Shopify Hosted Payment SDK, and (b) do not bypass any component of Shopify Checkout other than the collection of payment details and payment processing, do not violate Section 2.3.18 of the Shopify API Terms.
    
2.  If a Payment Gateway App is not made publicly available, the Payment Gateway Developer may permit Merchants to privately install the Payment Gateway Application, by providing Merchants with a shareable installation link.
    
3.  If a Payment Gateway Developer’s Payment Gateway Application meets the criteria set out in the Shopify Hosted Payment SDK guidelines: [help.shopify.com/api/sdks/hosted-payment-sdk/publish-gateway#private](https://help.shopify.com/api/sdks/hosted-payment-sdk/publish-gateway#private) for public listing by Shopify, the Payment Gateway Developer may apply to Shopify for a public listing. Depending on a number of factors determined and assessed by Shopify in its sole discretion, including transaction volume and Payment Gateway Application adoption rates, Shopify may make the Payment Gateway Application available to all Merchants via the Merchant’s admin and list the Payment Gateway Application in Shopify’s public list of payment gateways.
    
4.  Payment Gateway Developer must comply with any terms, guidelines or approval processes required pursuant to any card network rules, and applicable laws or regulations.
    
5.  Payment Gateway Developer represents, warrants, and covenants that, where applicable, it will at all times be certified as compliant with all provisions of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”) or any successor standards or requirements applicable to its performance as a Payment Gateway Developer under this Agreement. Payment Gateway Developer will, upon Shopify’s reasonable request, deliver reasonable evidence to Shopify of Payment Gateway Developer’s compliance with PCI-DSS.
    

Part D – Additional Terms Applicable to Shopify Experts, Experts Marketplace, and the Shopify Plus Partner Program
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the terms applicable to all Referral Partners, as set out in [Part B](#part-b), the following terms apply to Shopify Experts, Experts providing services in Experts Marketplace, and Partners accepted into the Plus Partner Program.

### 1\. Shopify Experts

**Designation**. From time to time Shopify may designate certain of its Partners as **“Experts”**, to be enrolled in the Experts Program and provided access to Experts Marketplace. Partners who meet the criteria may apply to become a Shopify Expert at any time, however the granting of an Expert designation is entirely within Shopify’s discretion.

### 2\. Experts Program

1.  **Program**. A description of Experts Marketplace is available at: [https://help.shopify.com/partners/faq/experts](https://help.shopify.com/partners/faq/experts). Experts must follow all Shopify guidelines set out here, as well as [Experts Marketplace Guidelines](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/selling-services/guidelines) to continue to access the Experts Marketplace.
    
2.  **Revenue Sharing Plan**. The revenue sharing plan for Experts participating in Experts Marketplace will be as outlined at: [https://help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn](https://help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn) (the “Experts Marketplace Revenue Share”).
    

### 3\. Experts Marketplace

1.  **Marketplace**. Experts may apply to be included in Experts Marketplace. Merchants may contact Experts or submit job requests in the Experts Marketplace (each a “Job Request”). Shopify may match Job Requests from Merchants with Experts or suggest multiple Experts to a Merchant in connection with any Job Request. Experts may propose work (submit a proposal) to Merchants that can be accepted to create a job.
    
2.  **Communications**. Expert acknowledges and agrees that Shopify receives and can review all communications exchanged via the Experts Marketplace or in any reply emails that originate within Experts Marketplace (directly or indirectly) between Expert and Merchant. As a participant in Experts Marketplace, Expert consents to being contacted by Merchants at the email address provided by Expert to Shopify.
    
3.  **Relationship**. The services provided by an Expert via Experts Marketplace are the responsibility of the Expert and not of Shopify. It is the Expert’s responsibility to ensure that there is a Merchant Agreement in place between the Expert and Merchant for the services to be provided by the Expert to the Merchant, and that the Merchant Agreement includes appropriate remedies in the event of non-payment by Merchant for services rendered by the Expert, provided that any such remedy that includes the withholding of the transfer of ownership of the Development Store or Merchant Store to the Merchant will be enforced by Shopify at its sole discretion.
    
4.  **Billing**. All Experts must use the Partner invoicing system embedded within Experts Marketplace to charge Merchants for Job Requests unless otherwise agreed to by Shopify in writing.
    
5.  **Taxes**. Expert is responsible for all applicable Taxes that arise from or as a result of: (a) payment of fees from Merchant to Expert; and (b) the Experts Marketplace Revenue Share payable to Shopify. Taxes collected on your Experts Marketplace Revenue Share by Shopify are based on Expert’s location. If you are exempt from payment of such Taxes, you must provide us with an original certificate that satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to tax-exempt status. Tax exemption will only apply from and after the date we receive such certificate. If you are not charged taxes by Shopify, you are responsible for determining if taxes are payable, and if so, self-remitting Taxes to the appropriate tax authorities in your jurisdiction.
    
6.  **Audits**. Shopify will have the right to appoint an independent auditor, under appropriate non-disclosure conditions, to audit Expert’s records to confirm Expert’s compliance with this Agreement. If such audit reveals non-compliance by Expert with the terms and conditions of this Agreement the independent auditor appointed by Shopify will provide Shopify and Expert with a report (along with supporting documentation) indicating the amount by which Expert has overstated or understated the payments due by Expert to Shopify and any other failures by Expert to fulfill its obligations under the Agreement. Prompt adjustment will be made by the proper Party to compensate for any overpayments or underpayments disclosed by any such audit. Shopify will bear all of the costs of any such audit, unless such audit reveals underpayment by, or overpayment to, Expert by more than five percent (5%) for the audited period, in which case, Expert will reimburse Shopify for all of the reasonable costs of such audit. In addition to the foregoing audit rights, Shopify will also have the right to use the capabilities of the Service to confirm the revenue associated with Job Requests performed by the Expert.
    
7.  **Reviews**. Merchants are able to submit reviews and ratings on their experience with an Expert. An Expert’s rating is calculated based on reviews posted by Merchants. Experts may not solicit or permit reviews that are fake, inaccurate, irrelevant, misleading, being used improperly for commercial gain, posted in exchange for a financial or other gain, posted multiple times (whether from the same or more than one account), misleading as to the reviewer's identity or their connection to the Expert being reviewed, or reviews that contain or link to prohibited or illegal content. Reviews are meant to be unbiased, useful and trustworthy. Shopify reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary in respect of an Expert engaged in any of this behaviour, including the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit Merchant reviews.
    

### 4\. Plus Partner Program

1.  **Designation**. From time to time Shopify may designate certain of its Experts and Partners as a **“Plus Partner”**, to be listed on the [Plus Partner Program site](https://www.shopify.com/plus/partners). A Plus Partner will be required to execute a Plus Partner Program addendum. The granting of a Plus Partner designation is entirely within Shopify’s discretion.
    
2.  **Revenue Sharing Plan**. The revenue sharing plan for the Plus Partner Program is set out in a Plus Partner addendum.
    

### 5\. Removal of Designation

Shopify may remove the Expert or Plus Partner designation, as applicable, at any time and for any reason, in its sole and absolute discretion, effective immediately upon notice to the relevant Expert or Plus Partner. Upon notice of the revocation of such designation by Shopify, Shopify will remove Partner from the Experts Marketplace or Plus Partner Program resources, and Partner will immediately cease referring to itself as a Shopify Expert or Plus Partner (as applicable) on any Website or otherwise.

Part E – Additional Terms Applicable to Ads in the Shopify App Store
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the terms applicable to Developers elsewhere in this Agreement, the following terms apply to Ads.

### 1\. Fees

1.  **Auctions**. The price Developers pay for an Ad, and whether or not the Developer wins an auction for an Ad to be displayed, will be based upon (1) the daily budget set by the Developer in the Partner Dashboard, (2) the amount bid for various keywords and (3) a confidential relevance score created by Shopify to ensure that Merchants and other users see Ads that are relevant and valuable to them. Shopify will solely determine which Ads will be shown and nothing in this Agreement guarantees that Developer will win any auctions to display their Ads, have their Ads displayed or get any impressions or clicks. All bids entered by Developer are binding offers from Developer which may be accepted or rejected by Shopify in its sole discretion.
    
2.  **Pricing**. The Developer will be charged for an Ad on a cost per click basis.
    
3.  **Payments**. The Developer will provide a payment method to Shopify and hereby authorizes Shopify to automatically charge such payment method for Ads purchased in compliance with this Agreement. Developer may not set-off any of its payments for Ads against any other amounts due to Developer under this Agreement. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by Shopify, Developer’s payment method may be charged by Shopify (1) each time the Developer reaches $100 in Ad fees, including if necessary, multiple times per day, or (2) every thirty (30) days, whichever comes first.
    

### 2\. Ads

1.  **Content**. Most of the content of the Ads will be generated by Shopify and will not be customizable by the Developer. Ad names and all other content provided by Developer must comply with Shopify’s Acceptable Use Policy. You hereby grant Shopify a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully paid license to store, use, reproduce and display any Ad names or other content provided by Developer for purposes of delivering the Ads and managing the service herein. Except as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to be a transfer, license or assignment of any intellectual property rights.
    
2.  **Keywords**. While the Developer may request certain triggering keywords for the Ads and negative triggering keywords as well, Shopify may prohibit and block the use of any keywords in its discretion. If broad keywords are selected by Developer, the actual triggering keywords implemented will be determined by Shopify in its sole discretion.
    

### 3\. Reporting

1.  **Reporting**. Shopify will provide the Developer with access to reporting through the Partner Dashboard. Shopify’s reporting is the sole and definitive measure of payment obligations for the Ads. All data in such reporting, and all usage and conversion data generated as a result of the Ads, is owned by Shopify. Developer may only use the reporting and metrics provided by Shopify to Developer for the performance and management of this Agreement and for its internal business purposes. Such reporting may not be shared by Developer with any third parties (other than on a confidential basis to its accountants and financial advisors).
    
2.  **Disputes**. In the event that Developer disputes any reporting, Developer must notify Shopify in writing within seven (7) days of the date the report is first made available to Developer by Shopify, otherwise the Developer acknowledges the accuracy of such reporting and waives any claims based upon such reporting thereafter.
    
3.  **Fraud**. The Developer agrees not to engage in, encourage, assist or authorize any third party to generate fraudulent traffic with respect to the Ads of any party, including but not limited to, through the use of bots or other means.
